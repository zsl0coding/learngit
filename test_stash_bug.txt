Assuming that you are working on branch_dev now, but you have to fix a bug
right away and the branch_dev need 2 days to complete, so what would you do?
Here is the solution:
1) stash the working branch_dev
	git stash
2)go back to "master" and make a new branch to fix the bug -- issue-bugNO
	git checkout master
	git checkout -b issue-bugNO
3)do something to fix the bug , then commit
	git ....
	git commit -m "fix the bug -- issue-bugNO"
4)go back to "master" and merge the branch "issue-bugNO"
	git checkout master
	git merge --no-ff -m "merged bug fixd NO" issue-bugNO
5)delete the branch "issue-bugNO"
	git branch -d issue-bugNO
6)then go back to branch "branch_dev" , there are two ways:
	1...	git stash list
		git stash pop
	2...	git stash list
		git stash apply	stash@{0}
##########
now you know how to fix a bug then go back to work.
