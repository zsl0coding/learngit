The well known command line is as follows:
"git remote add origin git@github.com:zsl0coding/learngit.git"

the word "origin" can be called by any other names, like "local2web" , 
I prefer the name "local2web"..

The command line above is just to connet local repository and the github server.The following command line is to push local repository:
"git push -u local2web master"
