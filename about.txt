I want to test "--no-ff" merge , so let's do it:
1) git checkout -b branch_dev
	so you are in the new branch "branch_dev"
2)make some modifications, like rewrite about.txt or adding a new line.

3)the commit in the branch "branch_dev"
	git add about.txt
	git commit -m "modified in branch_dev"
4)then go back to branch "master" and merge branch_dev
	git checkout master
	git merge --no-ff -m "merge with no--ff" branch_dev

5)look at the new log
	git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
